    DK1 - test scene does not work in Direct mode, display gets no signal
      AntTweakBar off

        Extended
          SDK
            crashes on glBindVertexArray()
          Client
            works fine, vsync toggle works - off yields noticeably less latency
        Direct
          CRASH sdl_main.cpp:646

          SDK
            A clear appears to be failing on rendertarget
            Any pixel without depth written to it after a clear is smeared
          Client - looks fine, no vsync control
        Extended
          SDK
            Compat
              smearing artifact feels odd in HMD - color buffer fails to clear
            Core
              depth buffer smears as well

              CRASH in ovrHmd_EndFrame(m_Hmd, renderPose, eyeTexture);

          Client
            works great, sustained 750fps, vsync won't turn on

          SDK
            CRASH in ovrHmd_EndFrame()
          Client

    DK2 - test scene works in direct and extended
      AntTweakBar off
      GLFW
        DebugHMD
          SDK
            smearing, or crash in BindVao depending on when render mode is switched
            getting a GLError: invalid value
            Could DismissInternal be deleting an incorrect VAO?
          Client
            works fine, VSync appears to have no effect
        Extended
          SDK
            looks OK when HSW is up, display won't refresh after it's dismissed until eventually, crash
          Client
            works, but very juddery
            VSync appears to stay off regardless of toggle, ~250 FPS
        Direct
          SDK, Client
            crashes at glfw_main.cpp:620 glfwSwapBuffers(g_pHMDWindow);
      SDL2
        DebugHMD
            SDK - crash in bindVAO, invalid operation
            Client - works fine
        Extended
          SDK
            get a GL Error: invalid operation on (maybe) the first VAO bind after DismissHSW
            Turn on vsync, wait until frame rate increases from 33 to 66(for only one reading), then switch: no GL error
          Client
            works, but very juddery
            VSync toggle appears to work, but yields sustained 33fps on, 250 off
        Direct
          SDK, Client
            crashes at sdl_main.cpp:646  g_HMDglContext = SDL_GL_CreateContext(g_pHMDWindow);
