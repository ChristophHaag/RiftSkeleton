  AMD Radeon HD 6670
  Driver 14.301.1001-.....OpenGL 6.14.10.13084
    DK1 - test scene does not work in Direct mode, display gets no signal
      AntTweakBar off
      SDL2
        DebugHMD
          CRASH sdl_main.cpp:646

        Extended
          SDK
            crashes on glBindVertexArray()
          Client
            works fine, vsync toggle works - off yields noticeably less latency
        Direct

          SDK
            A clear appears to be failing on rendertarget
            Any pixel without depth written to it after a clear is smeared
          Client - looks fine, no vsync control
        Extended
          SDK
            Compat
              smearing artifact feels odd in HMD - color buffer fails to clear
            Core
              depth buffer smears as well

              CRASH in ovrHmd_EndFrame(m_Hmd, renderPose, eyeTexture);

          Client
            works great, sustained 750fps, vsync won't turn on

    DK2 - test scene works in direct and extended
      AntTweakBar off
        GLFW
          DebugHMD - VSync appears to have no effect
          Extended
            works, but very juddery
            VSync appears to stay off regardless of toggle, ~250 FPS
          Direct
             crashes at glfw_main.cpp:620 glfwSwapBuffers(g_pHMDWindow);
        SDL2
          DebugHMD - works fine
          Extended
            works, but very juddery
            VSync toggle appears to work, but yields sustained 33fps on, 250 off
          Direct
            crashes at sdl_main.cpp:646  g_HMDglContext = SDL_GL_CreateContext(g_pHMDWindow);
